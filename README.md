# Trex-Runner-Clone
Have you ever played Google Dinosaur/T-Rex Game in chrome? I hope you did, whenever your internet goes down.  To be honest, itâ€™s a really addicting game that keeps you busy while Google Chrome continuously tries (behind the scenes) to get the connection back on your computer, tablet or even mobile.


Tried building the trex runner using JS and it was really a fun!
